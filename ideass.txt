Problems that need fixing:
> For short pulses, some residual noise is noticeable as the signal returns to zero. For a 2 ns FWHM pulse, the signal settles to a steady zero level approximately 2 ns after the main pulse. The amplitude of the residual oscillations decays by a factor of f=A_i+1/A_i=0.125 between successive peaks.
> The ct factor from testing.py should scale the u(t) form in such way to match the optical intenisty that is desired. But rather that modifying this factor, there can be done some twicks in the ppg's menu to adjust the voltage. This method would be preffered as every transmitted bit has a relative voltage to the baseline of the ppg, and for a factor of ct = 0.5 there is already loth of noise in the signal, making the useful one almost undistinguishable. For the moment, best factor to match also the initial transmitted form is 0.999, so it need to be taken in consideration when getting into further intensity calculations.
> Obs: i still don't understand how the output voltage of the ppg varies with its VREF value
>!!!! there is some need for debugging just to see that the light pulse would come out just right. So work to be done on plotting and other debugging
